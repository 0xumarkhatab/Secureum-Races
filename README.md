### Write-up

Race Link : [Check here](https://ventral.digital/posts/2022/3/8/secureum-bootcamp-epoch-march-race-5)

#### Code Review

1- Import of introspection contract (ERC-165)  -According to Openzeppelin
 " This set of interfaces and contracts deal with type introspection of contracts, that is, examining which functions can be called on them. This is usually referred to as a contractâ€™s interface."
 
2- `uri` method has to be external 

```solidity

function uri(uint256) public view virtual override returns (string memory) {
        return _uri;
    }
    
``` 


3- `balanceOfBatch` should be external

4- incorrect checks on array lengths are the same for both arrays `accounts` and `Ids`
```solidity

for (uint256 i = 0; i < accounts.length; ++i) {
            batchBalances[i] = balanceOf(accounts[i], ids[i]);
        }
        
```

5- `setApprovalForAll` has to be external

6- incorrect check for ownership in `safeTransferFrom`

```solidity
 require(
            from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
            "ERC1155: caller is not owner nor approved"
        );

``` 

The `from` should not be the caller and the spender should be approved of all tokens strictly 
to execute the next part.
otherwise, he would be the owner of the tokes and he can transfer any



7- incorrect operator calculation. `_safeTransferFrom` is called by the contract itself so this line inside the contract will return contracts address as an operator instead of the EOA that called `safeTransferFrom`

```solidity

   address operator = _msgSender();
   
```
 
 
 
8-Underflow vulnerability inside `_safeTransferFrom`

```solidity

    unchecked {
            fromBalance = fromBalance - amount;
        }
        _b
```

and overflow can't occur with following line ```solidity _balances[id][to] += amount; ```
because we are using solidity compiler 0.8.0 which checks itself outside the unchecked block.


9- invalid `isContract` calculation. The code size of the contract is greater than zero not equal to zero.


```solidity

    function isContract(address account) internal view returns (bool) {
        return account.code.length == 0;
    }


```

10- `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck` implements token rejection wrong.

it says 
```solidity

 if (response == IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155Received.selector) {

```

instead it should be like the response is not equal to the selector.


```solidity

 if (response != IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155Received.selector) {

```

for token rejection.


11- `catch` should check for a custom reason by checking if `reason.length==0` inside `_doSafeTransferAcceptanceCheck`


```
 try IERC1155Receiver(to).onERC1155Received(operator, from, id, amount, data) returns (bytes4 response) {
                if (response == IERC1155Receiver.onERC1155Received.selector) {
                    revert("ERC1155: ERC1155Receiver rejected tokens");
                }
            } catch Error(string memory reason) {
                revert(reason);
            } catch {
                revert("ERC1155: transfer to non ERC1155Receiver implementer");
            }

```


instead, it should be like openZeppelin's standard practice:


```solidity

catch (bytes memory reason) {
                if (reason.length == 0) {
                    // non-ERC1155Receiver implementer
                    revert ERC1155InvalidReceiver(to);
                } else {
                    /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
                    assembly {
                        revert(add(32, reason), mload(reason))
                    }
                }
            }



```

12- `_safeTransferFrom` should be internal

13- `Un-equal arrays length` vulnerability in `safeBatchTransferFrom`


```solidity

  for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
            uint256 id = ids[i];
            uint256 amount = amounts[i];

```


14-  Incorrect check for ownership in `safeTransferFrom`

The `from` should not be the caller and the spender should be approved of all tokens strictly 
to execute the next part.
otherwise, he would be the owner of the tokes and he can transfer any



```solidity

      from == _msgSender() || isApprovedForAll(from, _msgSender()),
            "ERC1155: transfer caller is not owner nor approved"
        );

```


15- `_safeBatchTransferFrom`same operator vulnerability as 7 

```solidity

address operator = _msgSender();

```


16-`_safeBatchTransferFrom` arrays length not equal vulnerability in a loop


17- incorrect require statement in `_mintBatch` 


```soldiity

 require(operator != address(0), "ERC1155: mint from the zero address");
      

```

as it is an internal function, the caller hence (operator=msgSender()) will always be the contract.


18- un-equal arrays length vulnerability in `_mintBatch`

```soliidty

  for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
            _balances[ids[i]][to] += amounts[i];
        }

```


#### Realized Later while solving questions

19- incorrect balance update in `_safeTransferBatch`


```solidity

 for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
            uint256 id = ids[i];
            uint256 amount = amounts[i];
            uint256 fromBalance = _balances[id][from];
            fromBalance = fromBalance - amount;
            _balances[id][to] += amount;
        }

```
20 - minting to zero address essentially means burning the tokens as they come to birth. PATHETIC!  ( lost my 0.33 marks in race here )

### Write up

Race Link : [Check here](https://ventral.digital/posts/2021/11/28/secureum-bootcamp-audit-findings-201-quiz)

Code Review:

- Only test variables are given, the production variables are commented
- No zero address check for _beneficiary in the constructor 
```solidity

 constructor(address payable _benificiary) {
        deployer = payable(msg.sender);
        beneficiary = _benificiary;
    }
    
    ```
    
- incorrect check in `startSale` , deployer or anyone with zero price as tx value can start sale

```solidity

require(msg.sender == deployer || _price != 0, "Only deployer and price cannot be zero");
 
 ```

- Unreliable source of randomness in `randomIndex` function

```solidity
  uint index = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(nonce, msg.sender, block.difficulty, block.timestamp))) % totalSize;
      

```

- Sale price decreases after every second + after the sale, the price is zero and it does not check if sale has eventually ended.

```solidity

  if (elapsed > saleDuration) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return ((saleDuration - elapsed) * price) / saleDuration;
        }
        
```

- in mint, when the duration of the sale has reached to end, the price will be 0. <br/> These lines will let the user mint upto TokensLimit tokens because 

contract balance = 0
price =0

the condition satisfies.
It transfers 0 funds and then mints.


```solidity

  require((address(this)).balance >= salePrice, "Insufficient funds to purchase.");
        if ((address(this)).balance >= salePrice) {
            payable(msg.sender).transfer((address(this)).balance - salePrice);
        }
        return _mint(msg.sender);

```

### Recommendation:
	- It should check msg.value instead of contract balance
	- PublicSale variable should be modified once saleDuration finishing is encountered
	- Function should not allow the minting at price=0
	

- Force Sending some Ether to the contract can do the exact same thing, <br/> actually stealing all the funds in the contract because the contract only checks for the balance of the contract rather msg.value.



## Race #2

![Screenshot-3](https://github.com/umaresso/Secureum-Races/assets/71306738/147e25a5-3514-4af7-9cf4-3f5412b9ef6a)

### Write up

Race Link : [Check here](https://ventral.digital/posts/2021/11/28/secureum-bootcamp-audit-findings-101-quiz)


Code Review :

- Anyone can see the mapping - Not really a vulnerability

- onlyWhenOpen modifier checks for the balance of the contract - vulnerable because anyone can send Force Ether.

- Constructor ensures that admin is zero address ```solidity require(_admin == address(0));``` . This is Funny: / - Vulnerable ofcourse because no one will ever be able to deploy a contract without zero admin and then no one call the admin access control functions because admin is zero address and that is not controlled by any 

- Non-re-entrancy guard should come before any other modifier 
` function join() external payable onlyWhenOpen nonReentrant `
 
 The value should not be strictly equal, this can cause discrepancies:

```solidity require(msg.value == membershipFee, 'InSecureumDAO: Incorrect ETH amount');```

rather consider doing something like >= so that people who accidentally sent one more wei
in the  Tx can still become member and not face the overhead of sending the Tx again cause it will fail in the current scenario.


- `whenNotPaused` modifier is not declared
- Remove all members function does not necessarily remove all the members



Questions:

For most of the questions, the explanation was more than enough!

But here are a few i've struggled with:

2.-

 what is "Guarded launch via circuit breakers"? - it is a mechanism in which the system can be paused in an extreme situation of crisis.

5.- 

Why not Option A?

`A. join() to not disclose msg.sender while joining the DAO`

We do not necessarily have to hide membership like membership in a club. Should be public.


Why Not Option B?

`B. createVote() to not disclose the possible outcomes during creation`


Any member can create the vote and it does not violate and privacy rules of the individual.
Rather votes should be seen by public for transparency and deciding where to cast their vote.


6.-


Why not Option C?


`getWinningOutcome() for existing _voteId`

In solidity, when we try to access a variable at a position in mapping, that is not initialized before, it returns the default value of the value type :

Here in the mapping:


```solidity mapping (uint256 => uint8) public winningOutcome;```


The key type is   - uint256
The value type is - uint8

default values for uint8 are 0 

So if we try to access a vote Id's winning outcome that does not exist in the mapping, we will still return the zero outcome which is not any outcome.

That's why we don't need to check if the vote id exists in this function.

And It's a wrap!
